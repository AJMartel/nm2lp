Convert Windows Netmon Monitor Mode Wireless Packet Captures to Libpcap Format

This version of nm2lp supercedes the previous Windows software nm2lp.exe.  I
just can't deal with Visual Studio anymore, so I wrote it for Linux.

This will probably build on other platforms as well, such as Windows (MingW)
and OS X, but I haven't checked.

See "INSTALL" for installation directions.  Usage is simple:

```
$ nm2lp <input-netmon-capture.cap> <output-libpcap-capture.pcap>
```

That's it!
